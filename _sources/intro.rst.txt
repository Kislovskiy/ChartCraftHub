.. introduction:

The idea of the workshop appeared after a chat between Teresa and Artem.
Many excellent resources out there teach you the basics of Maptlotlib.
Most of them are very good.
The few we particularly like are in the :doc:`resources` section.
While these resources excel in teaching plot creation, they often overlook code structuring for readability and maintenance, crucial as projects grow.

When your code is small, it's not a big deal, but when you start to have a lot of plots, that becomes a challenge.

The truth is that most of the time, it doesn't make sense to write everything from scratch.
Reusing other parts of the codebase is highly beneficial.
The "Code, debug, reuse this chart" workshop focuses on graphics integrity, code reusability, and maintainability.

We hope you'll enjoy it.

Happy plotting!
