---------------

We will encapsulate common plotting patterns into functions.
This will allow us to create complex figures with less code.
Plus, it makes experiments more enjoyable and less error-prone.

Creating abstractions
---------------------

However, as time passes, you will notice you are repeating yourself.
At the same time, maintaining your code is getting harder and harder.

The solution for this is to review your code refactor often.
Let's take a practical look at this.
