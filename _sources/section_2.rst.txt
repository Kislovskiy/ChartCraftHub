2. Efficient Figure Creation Tips: Abstracting Common Steps
===========================================================

In this section
---------------

We will encapsulate common plotting patterns into functions.
This will allow us to create complex figures with less code.
Plus, it makes experiments more enjoyable and less error-prone.

Creating abstractions
---------------------

There is nothing wrong with starting with a new script whenever you want to create a new figure.
However, as time passes, you will notice you are repeating yourself.
At the same time, maintaining your code is getting harder and harder.
You'll discover something cool and new, and you would also like the older code to benefit from it.

The solution for this is to review your code refactor often.
Let's take a practical look at this.

Summary
_______

We've created a simple example of Plot abstraction in Seaborn, a library build on top of matplotlib.

When you watch the examples it's quite impressive what you can build with matplotlib. https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html
