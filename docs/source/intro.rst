.. introduction:

The idea of the workshop appeared after a chat between Teresa and Artem.
Many excellent resources out there teach you the basics of Maptlotlib.
Most of them are very good.  The few we particularly like are in the :doc:`resources` section.  Most of them will teach you how to create beautiful plots.  However, most teaching materials rarely discuss how to structure code to make it easy to read and maintain.  When your code is small, it's not a big deal.  But when you start to have a lot of plots, it becomes a challenge to avoid spaghetti code.  The truth is that most of the time, it doesn't make sense to write everything from scratch.  Reusing other parts of the codebase is highly beneficial.  Code, debug, reuse this chart workshop focuses on graphics code reusability and maintainability.  We hope you'll enjoy it.  Happy plotting!
